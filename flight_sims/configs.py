For demonstrative purposes, here's the Cd functions from the ork files for Prometheus and Hyperion. They are basically indistinguishable.

Using the Prometheus one to project the Prometheus flight gives terrible results, doubling the error to about 2000 ft (at least as the sim and ork outputs stood on March 26th). 

Others are also experiencing underestimation of drag in their OpenRocket simulations:
