## Future Work
### Electrical Hardware Revision

Future work will also focus on the revision of the electrical hardware,
namely the manufacture and testing of the printed circuit board for the
presented Production Prototype version of the electrical system.

### Flight Computer Development

As the development of a complete flight computer is a large undertaking,
future development is required to satisfy this component. The team will
work closely with the sponsor to ensure that our development efforts run
parallel to their future development of SRAD flight computers.

### Software Integration

The core software components of the system presented complete herein
still require careful development and planning for their integration
into a single standalone program capable of running this entire complex
system.

### Model-Based Control for Drag Modulation

The current mechanism controller uses a look up table calculated offline
to determine the motor action required to produce the desired drag.
Future work will focus on the use of a Model Prediction Control
algorithm which uses an internal model of the rocket to predict the path
and actively mitigate deviations from the desired path in the presence
of external disturbances.
