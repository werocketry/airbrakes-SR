# Test Plan for Drag Characterization in Wind Tunnel

## General Information

- **Project:** Western Engineering Rocketry Team Drag Characterization
- **Facility:** BLWT 2
- **Test Type(s):** Drag Characterization
- **Test Date (approx):** End of February
- **Objective:** Characterize the drag as a function of different wind speeds and flap deployment angles

## Test Conditions

- **Wind Speeds:** Various speeds up to 30 m/s
- **Speed Selections:** 5, 10, 15, 20, 22, 24, 26, 28, 30 m/s
- **Deployment Angles:** 0, 5, 10, 15, 20, 30, 45 degrees
- **Test Duration:** Approximately 3 minutes per test at each wind speed, with about 5 minutes to change deployment angles between tests.
- **Setup Time:** 20 minutes initial setup
- **Total Test Time:** 20 + (6 * 5) + (3 * 9 * 6) = 212 minutes (approximately 3 hours and 32 minutes)
