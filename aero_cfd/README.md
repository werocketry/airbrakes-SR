# Aerdynamics & CFD Directory

For the purposes of the Capstone deliverables, Ansys Fluent was used for CFD because it was readily available to students. However, some preliminary
research suggests that an alternative software, OpenFOAM, may be more
accurate at simulating the fluid behaviour around rockets.

- From the repo: "*This project provides a complete toolchain for evaluating different rocket geometries at subsonic, transonic, and supersonic regimes. The work contained in this repository is part of a student project carried out at the Technical University of Munich (TUM) under the Master of Science (M.Sc) in Aerospace (year 2023).*"

## Aerodynamic Testing: Wind Tunnel

- Once the final aerostructure is complete and a test stand is developed
- This will allow for higher fidelity simulations that will inform design decisions and optimize the performance of the airbrakes system.

## CFD Future Work

- Refining and improving the existing CFD model for the overall rocket
    - Regarding solver accuracy
    - Fine-tuning the turbulence modelling parameters and the boundary conditions to achieve more precise predictions of flow behaviour
